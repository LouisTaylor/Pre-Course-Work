# Study Guide for Boot Camp

## Description

The project was created so that students, like myself, can be well versed and practiced prior to coding classes begining. This project can also be a memory aid in helping recall some of the functions, definitions and symbols used throughout. It can also be expanded upon during the duration of coding bootcamp. All of it feels like learning a foreign language, and equally as valuable and rewarding.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is a study guide which specifically teaches only about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. If the console is opened, it'll also provide a random topic generator for some fun interactivity.
